# Changelog

## [v1.1.0] - 2024-08-29
### Changed

- [[DAS-1934](https://bugs.earthdata.nasa.gov/browse/DAS-1934)]
  Input parameters that include both both resolutions (`xres` and `yres`) and
  dimenions (`height` and `width`) no longer always raise an exception. An
  exception is raised only when the parameters describe a grid that is not
  internally consistent. [#14](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-swath-projector/pull/14)

## [v1.0.1] - 2024-04-05

This version of the Swath Projector implements black code formatting across the
entire repository. There should be no functional changes to the service.

## [v1.0.0] - 2023-11-16

This version of the Harmony Swath Projector contains all functionality
previously released internally to EOSDIS as `sds/swot-reproject:0.0.4`.
Minor reformatting of the repository structure has occurred to comply with
recommended best practices for a Harmony backend service repository, but the
service itself is functionally unchanged. Additional contents to the repository
include updated documentation and files outlined by the
[NASA open-source guidelines](https://code.nasa.gov/#/guide).

Repository structure changes include:

* Migrating `pymods` directory to `swath_projector`.
* Migrating `swotrepr.py` to `swath_projector/adapter.py`.
* Addition of `swath_projector/main.py`.
