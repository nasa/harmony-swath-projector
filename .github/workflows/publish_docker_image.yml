# This workflow will run when changes are detected in the `main` branch, which
# must include an update to the `docker/service_version.txt` file. The workflow
# can also be manually triggered by a repository maintainer. This workflow will
# first trigger the reusable workflow in `.github/workflows/run_tests.yml`,
# which runs the `unittest` suite. If that workflow is successful, the latest
# version of the service Docker image is pushed to ghcr.io, a tag is added to
# the latest git commit, and a GitHub release is created with the release notes
# from the latest version of Swath Projector.
